But to really understand how they work, we need to dive into the math behind them, see why older models like RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs struggled with long sentences, and learn how the **attention mechanism** fixed these issues. Let’s break it down step by step, with simple explanations and examples.\n",

        "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were one of the first attempts to handle sequences like text. The idea was simple: process one word at a time and keep a \"hidden state\" that remembers information from previous words. Mathematically, for a sequence of inputs $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_T$, the hidden state $h_t$ at time step $t$ is calculated as:\n",
