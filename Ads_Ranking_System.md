# Advertisement Ranking and Recommendation System

### 1. **Entities and Data Structures in JSON for Data Sources**
Entities in an ad ranking system typically include information about users, ads, campaigns, and interactions. Here's an example of how the data could be structured in JSON:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "user_id": "12345",
    "age": 30,
    "gender": "Male",
    "location": "New York",
    "interests": ["Technology", "Fitness", "Travel"],
    "device_type": "mobile",
    "historical_clicks": [
      {"ad_id": "ad123", "timestamp": "2025-01-10T12:00:00", "click": true},
      {"ad_id": "ad456", "timestamp": "2025-01-12T15:30:00", "click": false}
    ]
  },
  "ad": {
    "ad_id": "ad123",
    "campaign_id": "camp567",
    "creative_type": "image",
    "targeting": {"age_range": "25-35", "interests": ["Technology", "Fitness"]},
    "budget": 10000,
    "start_date": "2025-01-01",
    "end_date": "2025-01-31",
    "clicks": 1200,
    "impressions": 15000
  },
  "campaign": {
    "campaign_id": "camp567",
    "ad_group_id": "grp123",
    "ad_ids": ["ad123", "ad456", "ad789"],
    "total_spent": 5000,
    "goal": "maximize_clicks",
    "bidding_strategy": "CPC"
  }
}
```

### 2. **Candidate Generation**
The candidate generation step involves identifying a pool of relevant ads for a user. This can be done based on targeting criteria like interests, demographics, and historical interaction data. Here are some common approaches:

- **Filtering Ads Based on User Profile:** 
  - Age, gender, location, and interests of the user.
  - Historical interactions (clicks, views, etc.).
  
- **Collaborative Filtering:**
  - Recommend ads based on similar users’ behaviors (user-based or item-based collaborative filtering).

- **Content-Based Filtering:**
  - Use the ad’s attributes like keywords, creative type, etc., to match ads with user interests.

JSON data for candidate generation might look like this:

```json
{
  "user_id": "12345",
  "ad_candidates": [
    {"ad_id": "ad123", "relevance_score": 0.85, "creative_type": "image", "targeting_match": 0.9},
    {"ad_id": "ad456", "relevance_score": 0.75, "creative_type": "video", "targeting_match": 0.8},
    {"ad_id": "ad789", "relevance_score": 0.65, "creative_type": "carousel", "targeting_match": 0.85}
  ]
}
```

### 3. **Feature Extraction**
Here are key features you may want to extract from your data:

- **User Features:**
  - Age, gender, location.
  - Historical clicks, conversion rates.
  - Interests and behaviors (e.g., frequency of ad interactions, session duration).
  - Device type (mobile, desktop, etc.).

- **Ad Features:**
  - Type of creative (image, video, carousel).
  - Targeting attributes (age range, location, interests).
  - Campaign details (bid type, budget, campaign goal).
  - Past performance (CTR, conversion rates).

- **Contextual Features:**
  - Time of day, day of the week, seasonal factors.
  - Device and browser data.
  - Geolocation.

Sample feature set for training data:

```json
{
  "user_id": "12345",
  "ad_id": "ad123",
  "user_age": 30,
  "user_gender": "Male",
  "user_location": "New York",
  "user_interests_tech": 1,
  "user_interests_fitness": 0,
  "ad_creative_type_image": 1,
  "ad_targeting_match": 0.9,
  "ad_campaign_goal_maximize_clicks": 1,
  "ad_bid_type_cpc": 1,
  "time_of_day_morning": 1,
  "device_mobile": 1,
  "historical_click_rate": 0.15
}
```

### 4. **Training Data Format**
Training data should be in tabular format where each row corresponds to a specific user-ad interaction (click or no-click). The target variable would be whether the user clicked on the ad.

Sample training data:

```json
[
  {
    "user_id": "12345",
    "ad_id": "ad123",
    "user_age": 30,
    "user_gender": "Male",
    "user_location": "New York",
    "ad_creative_type_image": 1,
    "ad_targeting_match": 0.85,
    "historical_click_rate": 0.12,
    "click": 1
  },
  {
    "user_id": "12346",
    "ad_id": "ad456",
    "user_age": 28,
    "user_gender": "Female",
    "user_location": "California",
    "ad_creative_type_video": 1,
    "ad_targeting_match": 0.75,
    "historical_click_rate": 0.05,
    "click": 0
  }
]
```

### 5. **ML Model Architecture**
A typical ML model architecture for ad ranking and recommendation could consist of the following:

- **Feature Processing Layer:**
  - One-hot encoding for categorical variables (e.g., creative type, gender, device).
  - Normalization/standardization for continuous variables (e.g., user age, CTR).
  
- **Model Layer:**
  - **Wide & Deep Model**: A combination of linear models (wide) and deep neural networks (deep). The wide part captures simple interactions (e.g., user’s age and ad targeting), while the deep part can learn more complex patterns (e.g., past interaction behavior).
  - **Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)**: Another powerful model for ranking problems, such as XGBoost or LightGBM.
  - **Neural Networks**: Multi-layered neural networks for learning non-linear patterns, especially in feature interactions.

- **Output Layer:**
  - Rank the ads by predicted relevance (e.g., probability of click-through).

### 6. **Evaluation**
Common evaluation metrics for ad ranking and recommendation systems:

- **CTR (Click-Through Rate):** Measures the proportion of ad views that lead to clicks.
  
- **NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain):** Measures ranking quality; high relevance ads should appear higher in the ranking.
  
- **AUC-ROC (Area Under the Curve - Receiver Operating Characteristic):** Measures the model’s ability to distinguish between clicks and non-clicks.

- **Log-Loss / Cross-Entropy:** Measures the accuracy of predicted probabilities.

Sample evaluation metrics:

```json
{
  "AUC": 0.88,
  "CTR": 0.05,
  "NDCG": 0.95,
  "LogLoss": 0.35
}
```

### 7. **Deployment and Post-Deployment Strategies**

- **Deployment Pipeline:**
  - Use containerization (Docker) and orchestration tools (Kubernetes) to deploy models.
  - Use A/B testing frameworks to test new models before fully rolling them out.
  - Rollout can be progressive, starting with a small user base and gradually scaling.
  
- **Monitoring:**
  - Continuously monitor metrics like CTR, NDCG, and latency.
  - Set up alerting systems to notify of significant drops in performance.

- **Model Updates:**
  - Retrain models periodically with fresh data to account for changes in user behavior and ad content.
  - Implement a pipeline for automatic retraining and deployment (CI/CD).

- **Feedback Loop:**
  - Use post-click behavior (e.g., time spent on site, purchases) as additional feedback to improve future ad recommendations.
  
- **Personalization:**
  - Personalize recommendations based on real-time user interactions and preferences.
