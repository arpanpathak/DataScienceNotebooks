        "**iBuddy** is an ethical AI-powered robot designed to foster productivity and professionalism in the workplace. This intelligent assistant uses edge AI models to detect non-productive behaviors such as gossip (PNPC), facilitate status updates, track tech debt, and monitor office pets. Our approach emphasizes **privacy-first computation**, **non-intrusive interaction**, and **real-time feedback** for maintaining an efficient, respectful, and healthy work environment.\n",
